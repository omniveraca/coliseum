      {
        question: 'Does stamped concrete hold up to Ottawa winters and freeze-thaw cycles?',
        answer: 'Yes, when engineered correctly. We pour air-entrained 32+ MPa exterior concrete over a deep, laser-graded 8-12" compacted aggregate base with positive slope away from structures. The air bubbles provide microscopic relief chambers where water can freeze and expand without rupturing the concrete surface.'
      },
      {
        question: 'Is stamped concrete slippery when wet or around pools?',
        answer: 'We incorporate a specialized micronized polymeric anti-slip additive directly into the protective sealer coat. This creates subtle microscopic traction that feels smooth to bare feet while providing sure grip in wet pool deck or rain conditions.'
      },
      {
        question: 'How often does stamped concrete need to be resealed?',
        answer: 'In the Ottawa climate, we typically recommend a simple reseal every 2 to 3 years depending on sun exposure and traffic. Resealing revitalizes the deep color contrast and renews UV and moisture protection.'

        question: 'Can you match or complement our existing brick and siding?',

        question: 'How does concrete compare to asphalt in cost and lifespan for Ottawa homes?',
        answer: 'While concrete has a higher initial investment than asphalt, its lifespan is typically 30 to 40+ years compared to 12-15 years for asphalt. Concrete does not soften in summer sun, does not rut under heavy vehicles, requires no smelly blacktop coatings every two years, and substantially increases home curb value.'

        question: 'Can snow plows and snowblowers damage a concrete driveway?',

        question: 'Why is our existing garage floor pitting and flaking near where the car tires park?',
        answer: 'This is caused by road salt and freeze-thaw spalling. In winter, salty snow from wheel wells melts onto the unsealed concrete. The salt lowers the freezing temperature, increasing the frequency of freeze-thaw cycles and eating into weak cement paste. Our dense mix designs and penetrating sealers prevent salt absorption.'
